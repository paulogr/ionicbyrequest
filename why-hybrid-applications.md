Hybrid mobile apps are like any other apps you’ll find on your phone. They install on your device. You can find them in app stores. With them, you can play games, engage your friends through social media, take photos, track your health, and much more.

Like the websites on the internet, hybrid mobile apps are built with a combination of web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The key difference is that hybrid apps are hosted inside a native application that utilizes a mobile platform’s WebView. (You can think of the WebView as a chromeless browser window that’s typically configured to run fullscreen.) This enables them to access device capabilities such as the accelerometer, camera, contacts, and more. These are capabilities that are often restricted to access from inside mobile browsers. Furthermore, hybrid mobile apps can include native UI elements in situations where necessary.

Ok, if you are very proeficiency on iOS platform, your favorite language is Objective-C and now Swift, you have everthing to go develop a native app.

But think about this:

## You're not targeting about 80% of the market!

And if you want to reach a greater audience either why you or your customer wants it, or because you don't want to miss the income from the millions of possible users, you will need another app.

And now you have to learn about Java and the Android SDK, or hire someone. You will end with 2 code bases you have to maintain, which will be a pain in the ass over time.

### The Downsides of Native

- Proficiency in each platform required
- Entirely separate code bases
- Timely & expensive development
- Diminishing returns

Welcome to 2015 ! Mobile devices have rapidly improved !


| Year | Device   | Processor         | RAM    |
|------|----------|-------------------|--------|
| 2007 | iPhone   | 620 MHz           | 128 MB |

Web-standards have rapidly improved too !!

- <a target="_blank" href="http://www.caniuse.com/">caniuse.com</a> is lookin' pretty good nowadays
- Android is now Chromium-based
- iOS users keep their devices up-to-date

## Conclusion

If you have really sure of why you need a native app, and all discussed above don't convinced you to go hybrid. You better go native.

Otherwise you are inside of the 50% hybrid applications <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2324917">Gartner predicts for 2016</a>
